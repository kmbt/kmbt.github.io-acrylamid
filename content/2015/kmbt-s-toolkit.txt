I've created a repository of various scripts I find useful in more or less everyday situations. I have called it ktk, which stands for "kmbt's toolkit". It is available at [github](https://github.com/kmbt/ktk) and currently contains test version of a script called `nbsp_pl` which I am going to describe in the next post.
