Let's assume you are running a Debian-based system and have a hard drive at `/dev/sdc` with a partition `/dev/sdc1`
mounted. To safely remove the hard drive, first you need to unmount all its
partitions. In this case you may do:

```
udisks --umount /dev/sdc1
```

and then spin the disk down with:

```
udisks --detach /dev/sdc
```

Please note, that we are referring here to the device `sdc` not its partition 
`sdc1`.
