When working on Python project you may sometimes forget to `.gitignore` your
`*.pyc` files and end up having them tracked by the repo.

To fix this you need use `git rm`:

```
find . -name "*.pyc" -exec git rm -f {} \;
```

Then, add a line:

```
*.pyc
```

to the `.gitignore` file in the repository root to have them permanently
ignored.
