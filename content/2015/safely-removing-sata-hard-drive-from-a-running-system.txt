title: Safely removing SATA hard drive from a running system

I have a Debian-based system with a SATA controller running in AHCI mode. I sometimes need to plug and unplug a disk from an internal SATA bay. The bay is nothing fancy - you just  slide a disk cradle into it and the SATA and power sockets make contact.

[Wyzard on Unix & Linux Stack Exchange](http://unix.stackexchange.com/a/43450) has an advice on how to do a proper hot unplug.

First you need to unmount the partitions. Then, deactivate any LVM groups with `vgchange -an` - I don't use LVM, so I haven't tried that. Finally, it is a very good idea to unregister device from the kernel and spin it down by 

```
echo 1 > /sys/block/(device name)/device/delete
```

Then I can hear the disk spin down, wait for it to stop completely and just pull it out. When I put in back in, it registers properly. Please note, that I am using AHCI mode in the controller.
